    "# Abstract\n",
    "This notebook uses Reinforcement learning and Open AI to play game Frozen Lake. Here an agent will play Frozen Lake.\n",
    "Goal of this game is to reach our goal without falling into a hole. So agent start from Starting State (S) and walks over the Frozen Tiles (F) escaping the Holes (H) to reach the Goal state (G). We do exploration and exploitation trade-off to solve the problem of Reinforcement learning. We use Q-learning for this as Q-learning is a value based Reinforcement learning algorithm."
